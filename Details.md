```if (Object.values(validations).some((value) => !value)) {
            setTouched({ name: true, }                
            );
            return undefined;
        }
```
This code is part of the handleSubmit function and it checks whether all of the form's validation checks have passed. If any of the validations fail, the code sets the touched state variable to true and returns undefined, preventing the form from being submitted.

The Object.values(validations) method returns an array of all the values in the validations object. The some method is then called on this array to check if any of the values in the array are false. If any value in the array is false, it means that a validation check has failed, so the some method returns true.

The arrow function value => !value passed to the some method is a shorthand way of checking if a value is false. If the value is false, the arrow function returns true (because the ! operator negates the false value). If the value is true, the arrow function returns false (because the ! operator negates the true value).

So, if any validation check fails (i.e., any value in the validations object is false), the some method returns true, and the if statement's condition is true. In that case, the setTouched method is called to update the touched state variable, setting name to true. This ensures that the error message is displayed next to the name input field.

Finally, the function returns undefined to prevent the form from being submitted.

BookingForm.js
The state variables used in this component are:

booking: An object that holds the current booking information, with a single property for the user's name.
touched: An object that holds the current touched state for each input field. This is used to determine whether or not to display validation errors.
validations: An object that holds the current validation state for each input field. This is used to determine whether or not to enable the submit button.
isSubmitted: A boolean value that determines whether or not the form has been submitted.


By adding `&& booking.name.length <= 200` to both onChange handler and the handleSubmit function, it ensures the validation.
The onChange handler is responsible for validating the input in real-time as the user types, while the handleSubmit function validates the input at the point of submission to ensure that it meets the required criteria.

It's true that there is some duplication of code, but this is often necessary to ensure that data is validated properly at each step of the process. The important thing is to keep the code clean and easy to maintain, so if you find yourself writing the same validation code in multiple places, you might consider extracting it into a helper function to avoid repetition.

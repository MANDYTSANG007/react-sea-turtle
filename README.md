# Sea Turtle 
Sea Turtle is a React app that features a modern and responsive user interface, with a clean and intuitive design that is easy to navigate. Here are some key features and components, such as:

- Routing: The app is designed with React Router, enabling users to navigate through multiple pages and components without having to reload the entire app.

- State management: The app utilizes React's state management to provide a dynamic UI. This includes user input validation and error handling, and real-time updates based on user actions.

- Responsive design: The app is designed to be responsive and scalable, ensuring that it looks great on different devices or screen sizes.

As an app developer, I'm passionate about creating engaging and user-friendly interfaces using React. In addition to my development work, I also enjoy logo design as a hobby, and I designed the app's logo myself. 

Feel free to explore the app and contact me if you have any questions or feedback!

## Future Development
Please note that currently, this app is a front-end only React app designed to showcase my front-end development skills. I'm always exploring new ways to improve and enhance the app. In the future, I may add additional features such as a testimonial feature, which would allow customers to leave feedback on their dining experience. I'm also open to the possibility of developing the back-end to create a more robust and fully-functional application.
